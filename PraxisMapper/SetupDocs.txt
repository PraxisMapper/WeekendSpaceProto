To setup PraxisMapper for your game:
	
	* Coppy the PraxisMapper folder from this project into your game
	* Drop the android folder int your game as well.
	* Add an Autoload to your game for PraxisMapper/Scripts/PraxisMapper.gd, and name it PraxisCore
	* Add an Android export target, and set some stuff in it
	* * At the least, it's enable Gradle build for the plugin
		and check the boxes for coarse/precise location permissions.
	* Make sure your game, somewhere, calls OS.request_permissions() to actually start getting GPS info.
	* * For best behavior. this should be on a screen that tells the user what its for and
		gives them a button to click to start it.
	
...Or use this project as the start of your game, it's got most of that already set up.
