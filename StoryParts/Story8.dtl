Boss: Fantasic work, Captain. One last task for you on this ship.
Boss: You've gone to a nearby place, a far away place, and a place inside a place. Now, you're going to a specific type of place.
Boss: We can determine 25 separate types of place. Some of them are rarely given a name. Not all of them are common in every area, and not all of them are guaranteed to be close or convenient. Some of them might even require paying to get into. But today, to fulfil all of those criteria, we're sending you to a library.
Boss: Stop in, flip through a book or two, and call us when you're ready to report back.  If you don't have anything in mind, I suggest picking up a book on some visual art and a book of poetry, and perusing those for a couple minutes each.
