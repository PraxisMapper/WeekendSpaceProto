Boss: Captain, where exactly are you? Our scanners didn't detect ANYTHING of interest to discover around you. No parks, nature reserves, cemeteries, universities, museums, libraries, art galleries, tourist attractions, theme parks, or zoos anywhere near you.
Boss: We checked every 6-digit cell around you in a 1 degree radius, and could not find an unvisited place. Nothing within 110km (70 miles).
Boss: Are you out on the open ocean? Hiding out near the North Pole? I say North, because there's several tourist points in Antartica you could visit if you're a particularly brave explorer, and those would have shows up on our scanners.
Boss: You might have already visited all possible places within range with the game open. If this is case, you're doing an excellent job of exploring without our command, but the odds of this are low, and with 7 million total points of interests we could choose, there aren't many places where this is easy to do.
Boss: For now, we can't assign your next mission to you. Try to hit the "Continue" again somewhere closer to gameplay-viable places or report a bug to the developer at PraxisMapper@gmail.com with your current PlusCode to help track down something bigger.
