Weekend Space Command is a locative (location-based) game. You need to play this one by getting out of your house and walking around with the game running and your screen on. You'll be asked to walk to particular types of places, and sometimes specific places. You will need to travel around 10 miles at one point, which for most people will require a car.
In this prototype, that's about all you'll have to do. In a full game, there could be puzzles to solve at each place, or tasks catered to the type of place you went to. Providing feedback, either through the discussion board for the game at cerol.itch.io or emailing praxismapper@gmail.com, is also welcome.
