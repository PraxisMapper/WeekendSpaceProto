Boss: Good to hear from you again, Captain. You remember how it was suggested to "make an afternoon out of it?" We meant it.
Boss: Your crew will be scouting and collecting measurements while you're here, which necesssitates the wait on your next assignment, but here's a tip you might not have realized last time you had to wait\:
Boss: The 15 minute timer is a minimum, not a maximum. As long as you come back to this place to report in, it doesn't matter how much time you do, or don't, spend here.
Boss: Maybe this place is much smaller than expected and there's not enough space to even get a decent walk in. Maybe it's really not your cup of tea and you'd prefer to be somewhere else. You know what you can do? Go somewhere else! 
Boss: Just stop back here to report in. You can trust your crew to handle the basic lab work and reports while you're ... let's call it "exercizing your authoritarial discretion" to visit somewhere more your personal style.
Boss: And yes, Central Command absolutely does have the technology to change your destination, or to allow you to choose a destination on your own. But this is an exploration mission, and that means leaving your own comfort zone sometimes. So you'll have to trust that Central Command has picked places worth visiting, even if they're a place you wouldn't have chosen on your own.
Boss: Anyways, the clock has started. We'll be waiting to hear back from you when you're done. It's 15 minutes away if there's absolutely nothing else for a Captain to do here on their day out, but don't be afraid to see some sights for a while and start that call on your own timeframe.
