Boss: Fantastic work, captain. With the confirmation that this area is secure, we can move on to the next exploration task.
Boss: We need to scout out {missionPlace}. Word is theres a MacGuffin there, some kind of old Earth relic that was very important even if we aren't exactly sure why.
Boss: I don't mean to blow my own horn here, but there's 2 details here you won't see in most games. First, the minimized data set can tell easily when one place is inside another. The second is that both minimized and full data can tell the actual bounds of places on the map, and when you are or aren't inside them, instead of treating all places like single points as Nyan-Tech does. We can also determine the type of each place easily, as you'll see later.
Boss: Free Enterprise just isn't going to get the important work done if there's enough money to be made doing nothing. That's why Research Fleet is proud to be a strong NGO with international and interplanetary support. We have a mission, funding, and no pressure to do anything but explore, learn, and report our findings for the good of everyone.
Boss: But that's far enough down that tangent. You know your task. Report in when you're at {missionPlace}.
