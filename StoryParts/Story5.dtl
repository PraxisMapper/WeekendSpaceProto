Boss: Fantastic work, captain. With the confirmation that this area is secure, we can move on to the next exploration task.
Boss: We need to scout out {missionPlace}, which should be inside or nearby {parentPlace}. Word is theres a MacGuffin there, some kind of old Earth relic that was very important even if we aren't exactly sure why.
Boss: I don't mean to blow my own horn here, but did you notice that the mission orders are aware that {parentPlace} covers {missionPlace}? This advance information is thanks to some extremely advanced technology. So advanced, it's been rejected from imports to Nyan-Tech research stations because, and I quote, "We can't figure this stuff out. We have points, why would need polygons?". 
Boss: Free Enterprise just isn't going to get the important work done if there's enough money to be made doing nothing. That's why Research Fleet is proud to be a strong government-backed organization. We have a mission, funding, and no pressure to do anything but explore, learn, and report our findings.
Boss: But that's far enough down that tangent. You know your task. Report in when you're at {missionPlace}.
